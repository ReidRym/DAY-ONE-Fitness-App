## Credits

Alright, brother, it's time to give credit where credit is due. This ain't just the Hulkster's victory, it's a victory for all the little Hulkamaniacs out there. You've been saying your prayers, eating your vitamins, and believing in the power of the Hulkster, and it's paid off, dude!

We've been in the ring with the evil MERN stack, and let me tell you, it's been a slobberknocker. But we didn't back down, oh no. We hulked up, ripped our shirts off, and dropped the big leg on it. And now, we've come out with the One Day or Day One App, a tool for all you Hulkamaniacs to use in your quest for fitness greatness.

So here's to you, all the little Hulkamaniacs who believed in us. This one's for you, brother. Keep saying your prayers, eating your vitamins, and believing in yourself. And remember, in the immortal words of the Hulkster, "Train, say your prayers, eat your vitamins, be true to yourself, be true to your country, and be a real American!"
